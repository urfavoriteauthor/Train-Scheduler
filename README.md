# Train-Scheduler
<!-- I was not able to get the moment.js working and I was also having issues capturing the from information and I'm not sure where I was having the issue there. IT is capturing form information but its showing as null/objects versus the actual text that is being entered. The next steps needed to finish would've been to complete the Firebase code setting the data references for the database to take in. Once that is done all of the trains added would then be able to caputure and store the information to be recalled to the table that is on the main page. A new object is being console logged but not appearing to the page -->
